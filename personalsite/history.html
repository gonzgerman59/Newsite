    <h2 class="general">General History of the Bruins</h3>
    
<p>The UCLA Bruins football program represents the University of California, Los Angeles, in college football as members of the Pac-12 Conference at the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS) level. The Bruins play their home games at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California.

    The Bruins have enjoyed several periods of success in their history, having been ranked in the top ten of the AP Poll at least once in every decade since the poll began in the 1930s. Their first major period of success came in the 1950s, under head coach Red Sanders. Sanders led the Bruins to the Coaches' Poll national championship in 1954, three conference championships, and an overall record of 66–19–1 in nine years. In the 1980s and 1990s, during the tenure of Terry Donahue, the Bruins compiled a 151–74–8 record, including 13 bowl games and an NCAA record eight straight bowl wins.
     Recent success has evaded them, though, landing them with a 16-19 overall bowl game record. The program has produced 28 first round picks in the NFL Draft, 30 consensus All-Americans, and multiple major award winners, including Heisman winner Gary Beban. The UCLA Bruins' main rival is the USC Trojans. 
    Chip Kelly became head coach in 2018.
    
    The Bruins were the Pac-12 Conference South Division champions for two years and played Pac-12 Football Championship Games in both 2011 and 2012.</p>
  <p>The controversy quieted somewhat until a picture of the bell was featured in a USC publication. This action re-ignited the rivalry, as students from UCLA retaliated by painting the Tommy Trojan statue on the USC campus. Trojan students then acted by burning their school's initials on several UCLA lawns. Police and school administrators had to be called to help quell the uprisings.

   
   On Nov. 12, 1942, the bell was wheeled in front of Tommy Trojan and the student body presidents of both institutions signed an agreement stating that thereafter the annual winner of the rivalry football game would keep possession of the bell for the next year. In that first season on the gridiron following the pact, the Bruins, under the direction of coach Edwin Horrell, defeated the Trojans, 14-7, to mark the first-ever Bruin win in the series. Later that season, the Bruin team went on to make its first ever post-season appearance in the 1943 Rose Bowl game.</p>
